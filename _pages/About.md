I am currently a **Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions (Marie Curie) Cofund Doctoral Fellow** at the **Department of Physics and Astronomy**, University of Bologna, Italy, within the interdisciplinary program on **Future Earth, Climate Change and Societal Challenges**. I live in Bologna, in the Emilia-Romagna region, and I’m honored to be part of the prestigious [MSCA FutureData4EU](https://site.unibo.it/futuredata4eu/en) project, funded by the **European Union**.

### Research Journey

Before beginning my Doctoral studies, I worked as a **Meteorology  Scientist**  at the Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System (RIMES), National Centre For Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) in New Delhi, India, contributing to weather model optimization, hazard risk assessments, and the development of real-time decision support systems for disaster-prone regions in India and Neighborhood countries .

Previously, I served as a **Junior Research Fellow** at the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru**,where I led [Meteorological Modeling tasks](https://icwar.iisc.ac.in/assets/pdfs/Media%20Coverage/deccanherald.com-IISc%20flood%20model%20heads%20to%20Bengalurus%20rescue.pdf), developed UWRF based real time rainfall forecasting systems, and integrated weather outputs with hydrology models for [Urban Flood Forecasting(UFM)](https://www.deccanherald.com/india/karnataka/bengaluru/iisc-flood-model-heads-to-b-luru-s-rescue-3031418) in Bangalore.

My academic research began with my **Master’s thesis** at the **University of Hyderabad**, where I investigated the Impacts of **land use/land-cover change and Indian Ocean SST warming on seasonal surface temperature patterns over Southern India using the WRF model**.

### Academic Background

I hold a **Master’s degree in Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences** from the [University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in/),where I received First Class honors. During this time, I developed a strong foundation in atmospheric modeling, weather forecasting, and numerical weather prediction.

Earlier, I completed a **Bachelor’s in Computer Science** at **Mahatma Gandhi University**, (Osmania University), Telangana . My computer science background inspired my interest in using programming, data science, and cloud technologies to tackle challenges in climate and environmental research.

### Personal Background

I was born in a rural village called [Peddanemila](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pedanemila/@17.348783,79.7701355,295m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x3a34c19f9be9391d:0x6b4e959373008fd9!2sNuthankal,+Telangana+508221,+India!3b1!8m2!3d17.3321865!4d79.6955303!16s%2Fm%2F0gg8qfp!3m5!1s0x3a34eb66ac4fc0cf:0x5b2d32651f5adba8!8m2!3d17.3482832!4d79.7696801!16s%2Fg%2F11qbkt8dj2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYxNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) and raised in [Hyderabad](https://youtu.be/-1FBsUq5HzU), Telangana; lovingly known as the [**Biryani City of India**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabadi_biryani), India. Thanks to my Ammananna love for travel, I had the opportunity to explore many corners of India early in life an experience that shaped my cultural curiosity and appreciation for diversity.

### Life Beyond Science

Outside academia, I have a deep love for **reading**, **writing poetry and books**, **reviewing literature**, and **coding**. I often find myself mesmerized by tools like **Google Earth**, or simply gazing out of airplane windows trying to recognize cities by their unique layouts, coastlines, or night lights. Over time, this has become a joyful habit like a personal "neural network" of the world in my mind.

I’m also working on a few creative projects:

- A [**Podcast Series**](https://nagsclimate.github.io/creative-space/) exploring the intersections of climate, cities, and society
    
- Sharing my personal [**Poetry and Photography**](https://nagsclimate.github.io/creative-space/)
    
Stay tuned for more updates!
