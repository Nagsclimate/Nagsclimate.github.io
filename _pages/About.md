Hello!! I am Nagaraju Gaddam. I am currently Marie Curie cofund doctoral Fellow working at the University of Bologna. I am currently living in Bologna, Emila Romagna Province.Here's my [work profile](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/nagaraju.gaddam2/).

I did my Masters of Science at [University of  University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in/) at the [Centre for Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences ](https://centres.uohyd.ac.in/ceoas/). My masters thesis focussed on **Impact of Land-use Land-cover changes on Seasonal Surface Temperature (SST) over Southern India using a Regional Climate Model**. My Masters has been a truly trans-disciplinary and nomadic experience,the benevolence of my supervisor - [Prof. Karumuri Ashok](https://vidwan.inflibnet.ac.in/profile/80235), and of course, the revolution of Modeling and Computing! I have had the privilege to travel extensively for collaborations, workshops, and conferences. I believe that this freedom and global exposure has molded my research philosophy greatly.

Prior to my Ph.D., I did my Masters degree in [Architectural Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE/Academics/Groups/Architectural) at Purdue. I worked specifically on building energy consumption patterns for different Urban Land Use Land Cover types characterized by [Local Climate Zones](http://www.wudapt.org/). For detailed discussions on my research and its outcomes, visit the Research and Publications section, and explore the Projects section for some interesting projects.

I come from India, where I have mostly lived in Ranchi - my hometown (now known as [Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni)'s hometown), and in Roorkee - during my undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering at [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/). However, thanks to my parents' avid interest in traveling, I have been all around this incredibly diverse country. I highly recommend it to fellow travelers who love colors, noise, crowds, food, and affordability!

Apart from science, I am into [music](/music/) and maps! I have discovered through my day-to-day Ph.D. work that I love to look at the Earth using satellite imagery. I have spent countless hours on Google Earth and in flights admiring the natural and the engineered beauty (cities) of our planet. To the point where the Neural Networks in my brain now recognize most cities by a fragment of its road network, coastline, bend of its river, night lights distribution, or maybe just a raw Landsat image. These days, I can be found staring at the [Live Aerial screen savers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208992) hosted by Apple TV.
