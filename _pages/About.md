Hello! I'm **Nagaraju Gaddam**, a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Cofund Doctoral Fellow at the **University of Bologna**, Italy. I currently live in Bologna, in the Emilia-Romagna region, and I‚Äôm part of the prestigious **FutureData4EU** project, funded by the **European Union**.

üëâ [My official work profile](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/nagaraju.gaddam2)

I‚Äôm enrolled in the interdisciplinary Ph.D. program, [**Future Earth, Climate Change and Societal Challenges**](https://phd.unibo.it/future-earth-climate-change-societal-challenges/en), where my research focuses on:

> **Numerical downscaling at the local microscale for the evaluation of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures**

I'm extremely thankful for the support of the [**MSCA Cofund Fellowship**](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/), and fortunate to be working under the mentorship of [Prof. Silvana Di Sabatino](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE/People/view_person?resource_id=2131), Dr. Carlo Cintolesi, and Dr. Paolo Ruggeri.

### Academic Journey

Before my Ph.D., I completed my Master‚Äôs in [**Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences**](https://centres.uohyd.ac.in/ceoas/) at the [**University of Hyderabad**](https://uohyd.ac.in/). My thesis explored the **impact of land-use and land-cover changes on seasonal surface temperature over Southern India** using a regional climate model.

During my undergraduate years, I studied **Computer Science** at **Mahatma Gandhi University** in Hyderabad, India. This background ignited my interest in data science and its applications in climate and environmental systems ‚Äî especially with the revolution of **cloud computing** in recent years.

### Personal Background

I was born and raised in **Hyderabad**, Telangana ‚Äî fondly known as the [**Biryani City of India**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabadi_biryani). Thanks to my parents' love of travel, I‚Äôve explored many corners of India ‚Äî an experience that‚Äôs shaped my cultural appreciation and curiosity.

Over the years, I‚Äôve had the chance to travel globally for **workshops**, **collaborations**, and **conferences**. These journeys have deeply influenced my outlook on research, climate action, and society.

### Life Beyond Science

Outside academia, I enjoy exploring **music**, **maps**, **satellite imagery**, and **poetry**. I‚Äôve spent countless hours looking at Earth through tools like **Google Earth**, watching **Apple TV‚Äôs Live Aerial screensavers**, or admiring landscapes during flights.

In fact, I‚Äôve developed a sort of mental ‚Äúneural network‚Äù that helps me identify cities from a single glimpse of their road layout, coastlines, river bends, or night lights. It‚Äôs one of my quirky joys!

I‚Äôm also planning to share:
- A **podcast series** on climate, cities, and society
- My personal **poetry and photography**
- Resources and insights for early-career climate researchers

Stay tuned for updates on these!
