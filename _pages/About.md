I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Caltech](https://rsfralab.github.io/people/staff/anamika.html) and [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/anamika-shreevastava/). I am starting as [Assistant Professor at NYU](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/anamika-shreevastava) in Fall 2025 with a joint appointment in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) and the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP). My research focuses on the complex interplay between cities and extreme weather, with a particular emphasis on the emergence and impacts of extreme heat in urban environments worldwide. I use various tools and techniques from numerical weather modeling and remote sensing to find equitable solutions to climate and environmental injustice within cities.

During my PhD from Purdue University, I pioneered the concept of "*fractal intra-urban heat islets*", characterizing the spatial heterogeneity of urban heat islands. I demonstrated that these heat islets exhibit a common fractal structure across diverse cities, laying the groundwork for globally adaptive models of heat emergence. My postdoctoral work at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Caltech advanced thermal remote sensing and urban microclimate monitoring, contributing to innovative sensing technologies and deepening the understanding of how extreme heat disproportionately affects the urban poor and historically marginalized communities in Los Angeles. Committed to translating research into practical climate adaptation solutions, I have also served as a science ambassador and member of applied science teams at NASA JPL, actively collaborating with private and public institutions in California to develop cooling solutions for urban neighborhoods.

I come from India, where I've spent most of my life in Ranchi—my hometown, now famous as Dhoni’s hometown—and in Roorkee, where I earned my undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering from IIT Roorkee. Beyond science, I have a passion for music and maps. Through my work, I’ve discovered my love for viewing the Earth through satellite imagery. I’ve spent countless hours on Google Earth and during flights, marveling at both the natural and engineered beauty of our planet. By now, the neural networks in my brain can recognize most cities from just a fragment of their road networks, coastlines, river bends, night light patterns, or even raw Landsat images.

### Research Philosophy

My research philosophy is grounded in viewing extreme weather and urban socio-physical systems as two interconnected, dynamic systems that interact across multiple spatiotemporal scales. Cities, for instance, are composed of spatially heterogeneous *forms*—buildings, road networks, and infrastructure that evolve over decades—and *functions* such as mobility, energy consumption, and anthropogenic emissions that fluctuate daily. Similarly, extreme weather and climate events emerge from nonlinear interactions between land, atmosphere, and ocean systems, driven by multi-scale feedback mechanisms.

A key outcome of the interplay between these two complex systems is the Urban Heat Island effect, a phenomenon I focused on during my PhD. UHIs result from the excess heat generated within cities due to their unique structure and functions. On a broader scale, heatwaves not only damage ecosystems—affecting forests, croplands, water resources, and the eco-hydro-climatic balance—but also exacerbate urban stress by depleting natural resources and forcing climate-driven migration to cities, creating long-term challenges.

The path to building *climate-resilient cities* lies in deepening our understanding of the intricate interdependencies and feedbacks between urban areas and their microclimates. To this end, my research leverages techniques from complexity science, data science, numerical weather modeling, and remote sensing to unravel these interactions and inform urban adaptation strategies.

Hello!! I am Anamika. I am a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I am currently living in Pasadena, California. Here's my [work profile](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/anamika-shreevastava/).

I did my Ph.D at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) in an interdisciplinary program called [Ecological Sciences and Engineering](https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/ese/). My doctoral thesis focussed on **Characterizing the intra-urban complexity of the Urban Heat Island**. My Ph.D. has been a truly trans-disciplinary and nomadic experience, thanks to the amazing [NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-stats/nasa-earth-and-space-science-fellowship-nessf-selections), the benevolence of my Ph.D. advisor - [Prof. Suresh Rao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE/People/view_person?resource_id=2131), and of course, the revolution of Cloud Computing! I have had the privilege to travel extensively for collaborations, workshops, and conferences. I believe that this freedom and global exposure has molded my research philosophy greatly.

Prior to my Ph.D., I did my Masters degree in [Architectural Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE/Academics/Groups/Architectural) at Purdue. I worked specifically on building energy consumption patterns for different Urban Land Use Land Cover types characterized by [Local Climate Zones](http://www.wudapt.org/). For detailed discussions on my research and its outcomes, visit the Research and Publications section, and explore the Projects section for some interesting projects.

I come from India, where I have mostly lived in Ranchi - my hometown (now known as [Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni)'s hometown), and in Roorkee - during my undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering at [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/). However, thanks to my parents' avid interest in traveling, I have been all around this incredibly diverse country. I highly recommend it to fellow travelers who love colors, noise, crowds, food, and affordability!

Apart from science, I am into [music](/music/) and maps! I have discovered through my day-to-day Ph.D. work that I love to look at the Earth using satellite imagery. I have spent countless hours on Google Earth and in flights admiring the natural and the engineered beauty (cities) of our planet. To the point where the Neural Networks in my brain now recognize most cities by a fragment of its road network, coastline, bend of its river, night lights distribution, or maybe just a raw Landsat image. These days, I can be found staring at the [Live Aerial screen savers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208992) hosted by Apple TV.
