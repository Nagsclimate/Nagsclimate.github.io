  Welcome to the Urban Planet Lab!
  <br>
  Welcome to my website—a space where science meets cities, and climate meets community.
  
  As the world becomes increasingly urban, cities are emerging as the frontline of our planet’s most pressing challenges—extreme heat, flooding, pollution, and environmental inequality. Through my research, I explore the deep, often invisible connections between urban environments and the climate system, working to uncover how city design, infrastructure, and social structures influence—and are influenced by—extreme weather.
  
  My work blends numerical weather modeling, remote sensing, data science, and complexity theory to understand how urban systems function under stress, and how we can build more resilient, equitable cities. From fractal patterns of urban heat to satellite-driven insights on microclimates, my goal is to translate science into solutions—solutions that are not only technically sound, but socially just.
  
  Whether you're a student, collaborator, policymaker, or fellow explorer of Earth’s urban future—thank you for visiting. I invite you to explore my work, reach out, and join the conversation on shaping cities that can thrive in a changing climate.
