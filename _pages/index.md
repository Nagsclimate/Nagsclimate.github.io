excerpt: >
  Welcome to my website—a space where science meets cities, and climate meets community.  
  My research explores how urban environments interact with extreme weather, using tools like numerical weather modeling, remote sensing, and data science.  
  I focus on understanding and addressing challenges like urban heat, flooding, and climate inequality to help build more resilient and just cities.  
  Whether you're a student, researcher, or urban enthusiast—thank you for visiting. I hope you find insights here that inspire collaboration and action.
