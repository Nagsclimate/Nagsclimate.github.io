  ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!
  <br><br>
  Iâ€™m **Nagaraju Gaddam**, a passionate researcher and entrepreneur working at the intersection of urban climate science and data innovation. With a strong background in Computer Science, Atmospheric Sciences, and Weather Modeling, I specialize in developing real-time forecasting tools, climate risk frameworks, and decision support systems for sustainable urban futures.
  <br><br>
  My work focuses on transforming complex environmental data into actionable insights that help cities become more resilient, inclusive, and adaptive to climate change. I believe in bridging the gap between science, policy, and society through open knowledge, collaboration, and community-driven innovation.
