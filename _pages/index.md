excerpt: >
  <br>
  Welcome to my website a space where science meets cities, and climate meets community.
  
  My research explores how urban environments interact with extreme weather, using tools like Numerical weather modeling, remote sensing, and data science. I focus on understanding and addressing challenges like urban heat, flooding, and climate inequality to help build more resilient and just cities.
  
  Whether you're a student, researcher, or urban enthusiast—thank you for visiting. I hope you find insights here that inspire collaboration and action.
