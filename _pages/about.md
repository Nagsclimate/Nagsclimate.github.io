I’m Nagaraju Gaddam, currently a Marie Curie Doctoral Researcher at the [University of Bologna (Unibo)](https://www.unibo.it/en) and the [Department of Physics and Astronomy (DIFA)](https://physics-astronomy.unibo.it/en/index.html). In Fall 2025, I will join [New York University (NYU)](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/anamika-shreevastava) as an Assistant Professor with a joint appointment in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) and the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP).

My research focuses on the dynamic interplay between cities and extreme weather—particularly the growing threat of extreme heat in urban environments around the world. I employ a combination of numerical weather modeling, remote sensing, and data science to uncover patterns and mechanisms behind urban heat stress, aiming to develop equitable and climate-resilient solutions for cities, especially those affected by environmental injustice.

### Academic Journey

I earned my PhD from Purdue University, where I introduced the concept of *fractal intra-urban heat islets*—a novel framework for understanding the spatial heterogeneity of urban heat islands. My work revealed that these heat islets share a consistent fractal structure across global cities, providing a foundation for adaptive modeling of urban heat at multiple scales.

As a postdoctoral researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Caltech, I advanced methods in thermal remote sensing and urban microclimate monitoring. This included contributions to cutting-edge sensing technologies and collaborative work with public and private sectors in California to develop neighborhood-scale cooling solutions. I also served as a science ambassador and member of several applied science teams at NASA JPL.

### Research Philosophy

My research philosophy is rooted in viewing extreme weather and urban systems as interlinked, evolving entities. Urban environments comprise spatially heterogeneous *forms* (such as infrastructure and land cover) and temporally variable *functions* (like energy use and emissions). These interact with atmospheric dynamics and land–ocean feedbacks, creating nonlinear effects such as the Urban Heat Island (UHI).

UHIs are not isolated events—they are outcomes of deep, systemic interactions between urban form-function and the broader climate system. Heatwaves, for example, degrade natural ecosystems and intensify urban vulnerabilities, often disproportionately affecting marginalized populations. This understanding drives my pursuit of science-informed, community-focused climate adaptation strategies.

### Personal Background

I was born and raised in India—mostly in Ranchi (widely known as MS Dhoni’s hometown) and Roorkee, where I completed my undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Roorkee). My early exposure to both nature and infrastructure shaped my appreciation for the intersection of environment and design.

Outside of research, I am passionate about music and cartography. I’ve spent countless hours exploring Earth through satellite images, whether on Google Earth or during flights—captivated by the beauty of coastlines, cityscapes, and river bends. Over time, I’ve developed a near-intuitive ability to recognize cities by their road networks, night lights, and geographic features—even in raw satellite imagery.

### Looking Ahead

At NYU and beyond, I aim to continue unraveling the complexity of urban climate systems through interdisciplinary research, education, and community engagement. My long-term vision is to help design sustainable, inclusive cities that can withstand the changing climate while improving quality of life for all their inhabitants.

Hello!! I am Anamika. I am a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I am currently living in Pasadena, California. Here's my [work profile](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/anamika-shreevastava/).

I did my Ph.D at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) in an interdisciplinary program called [Ecological Sciences and Engineering](https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/ese/). My doctoral thesis focussed on **Characterizing the intra-urban complexity of the Urban Heat Island**. My Ph.D. has been a truly trans-disciplinary and nomadic experience, thanks to the amazing [NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-stats/nasa-earth-and-space-science-fellowship-nessf-selections), the benevolence of my Ph.D. advisor - [Prof. Suresh Rao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE/People/view_person?resource_id=2131), and of course, the revolution of Cloud Computing! I have had the privilege to travel extensively for collaborations, workshops, and conferences. I believe that this freedom and global exposure has molded my research philosophy greatly.

Prior to my Ph.D., I did my Masters degree in [Architectural Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE/Academics/Groups/Architectural) at Purdue. I worked specifically on building energy consumption patterns for different Urban Land Use Land Cover types characterized by [Local Climate Zones](http://www.wudapt.org/). For detailed discussions on my research and its outcomes, visit the Research and Publications section, and explore the Projects section for some interesting projects.

I come from India, where I have mostly lived in Ranchi - my hometown (now known as [Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni)'s hometown), and in Roorkee - during my undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering at [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/). However, thanks to my parents' avid interest in traveling, I have been all around this incredibly diverse country. I highly recommend it to fellow travelers who love colors, noise, crowds, food, and affordability!

Apart from science, I am into [music](/music/) and maps! I have discovered through my day-to-day Ph.D. work that I love to look at the Earth using satellite imagery. I have spent countless hours on Google Earth and in flights admiring the natural and the engineered beauty (cities) of our planet. To the point where the Neural Networks in my brain now recognize most cities by a fragment of its road network, coastline, bend of its river, night lights distribution, or maybe just a raw Landsat image. These days, I can be found staring at the [Live Aerial screen savers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208992) hosted by Apple TV.
