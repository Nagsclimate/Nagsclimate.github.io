Cities, situated at the crossroads of rising temperatures and growing populations, bear the brunt of climate change and must adapt to the *new normal* of extreme weather impacts. Among the most dangerous of these hazards is extreme heat, which continues to intensify in frequency, severity, and duration. Today, we face both a crucial responsibility and a unique opportunity to implement urban design interventions and adaptation strategies that will equip cities to withstand the impacts of climate change in the coming century. Our lab focuses on exploring innovative urban design and climate adaptation strategies to combat the growing threat of extreme heat, especially in rapidly developing cities.


### Ongoing research directions

| **Can improved urban spatial design mitigate extreme heat?** We investigate how the spatial distribution of heat sources (e.g., factories, densely built areas) and heat sinks (e.g., parks, wetlands) interacts within a city's thermodynamic network. By modeling heat flows and interactions using complex network techniques, we aim to identify the most vulnerable urban regions and allocate heat mitigation resources effectively. |

| **How effective are urban cooling solutions?** We model the impact of urban morphology (e.g., building heights, cool streets, green infrastructure) on local temperatures and explore their potential to reduce urban heat. Using advanced modeling tools like the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model combined with remote sensing data, we simulate and evaluate various cooling strategies to inform better urban planning. |

| **How does rapid urban growth intersect with extreme heat?** In rapidly urbanizing areas, such as cities in India, the emergence of extreme heat is intensifying, yet global climate models often fail to capture the intra-urban variability of heat exposure. Our lab seeks to address these gaps, focusing on the intersection of urban growth and climate extremes to better protect vulnerable urban populations. |

By integrating urban design, advanced modeling techniques, and spatial data analysis, our lab aims to contribute to more resilient, sustainable cities.

## Doctoral Research Themes

| **Urban Heat Islands as an archipelago of Fractal intra-urban heat islets** <br> <br> Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHI) are traditionally quantified by a bulk metric of SUHI Intensity. However, cities are highly spatially heterogeneous and temperatures within vary widely. Inspired by the [fractal nature of cities](http://www.complexcity.info/), we show for the first time, that for diverse cities across the world, SUHIs are fractal in nature. We analyze the SUHI as a collection of *intra-urban heat islets* and leverage the self-similarity to develop comprehensive metrics to quantify intra-urban thermal complexity. <br> <br> Read more: [[Phys. Rev. E.](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.032142)] [[SPIE Remote Sensing](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2501441)] [[EarthArXiv Preprint](https://eartharxiv.org/t9s3g)] [[Poster Summary](/assets/files/Poster_LCLUC_Anamika.pdf)] | <img src="/assets/images/PRE_pic2.png" width="1600px" alt="PRE"> |

| **Paradox of expansion vs densification for reducing extreme urban heat** <br> <br> Given the heterogeneity of urban temperatures for various urban morphologies, what is the optimal spatial pattern to improve thermal comfort? Here, we build upon the multi-scale framework of intra-urban heat islets and investigate the impact of expansion (sprawl) vs densification of cities on the emergence of extreme heat islets. We find that a sprawling configuration is favorable for reducing the mean temperature of a city. However, for the same mean SUHI intensity, it also results in higher local thermal extremes.  <br> <br> Read more: [[Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56091-w)] [[EarthArXiv Preprint](https://eartharxiv.org/gxj9m/)] | <img src="/assets/images/NSR_pic2.png" width="1800px" alt="NSR"> |

| **Influence of heat waves on intra-urban heat islets** <br> <br> Heat waves are known further exacerbate the urban heat islands. I am currently working in collaboration with NOAA's Center for Earth System Sciences and Remote Sensing Technologies ([NOAA-CESSRST](https://www.noaacrest.org/)) to explore the impact of such heat waves on the dynamics of intra-urban heat islets and the role of complex urban morphology in this interaction. I am using a combination of remotely sensed observations as well as the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model to simulate the heat waves of 2018 experienced by three major megacities - Paris, Los Angeles, and New Delhi | <img src="/assets/images/Paris.png" width="1800px" alt="Paris"> |

## Master's Research Themes

| **Resilience Analysis of Climate Proofing strategies of cities** <br> <br> Cities are at the forefront of climate change impacts and face a growing burden of adaptation to ensuing natural hazards. In response, the global network of [C-40 Cities](https://www.c40.org/) have adopted various strategies to “climate proof” themselves. Here, we use the Stability Landscape model of a *ball-in-a-bowl*, adapted from [Walker et. al. (2004)](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss2/art5/inline.html), to investigate the [top 100 strategies](https://issuu.com/sustainia/docs/cities100) of 2015 from an Urban Resilience viewpoint. With this model, we are able to demonstrate the need and possible pathways for adaptation to climate extremes in a more comprehensive way. <br><br> Get in touch for further details: [[View Poster](/assets/files/C40_AMS-Poster.pdf)] [[Presentation](/assets/files/C40_report.pdf)] | <img src="/assets/images/C40-header.png" width="2400px" alt="C40"> |

| **Impact of spatial organization of Local Climate Zones on Urban Surface temperatures** <br> <br> [Local Climate Zones (LCZ)](http://www.wudapt.org/lcz/) are an urban land cover land use classification system that help standardize methods of observation and documentation in urban heat island studies. It is based on a random forest classification workflow implemented in SAGA GIS. I worked on developing LCZ maps for diverse cities across the world. While there is a point-to-point correlation between the LCZ classes and Urban Temperatures, the spatial neighborhoods of each LCZs strongly influence the temperature distributions as well. <br><br> Read more: [[Poster](/assets/files/LCZ_LST_AMS-poster.pdf)] [[BAMS Article](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0236.1)] | <img src="/assets/images/LCZ.png" width="1600px" alt="LCZ"> |
